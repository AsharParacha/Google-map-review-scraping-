dan geno,Great place to stop have a drink and burger on the river, 4 stars 
Dave,"My wife and I had a great time staying here. We had a room on the Chena side near the ""Love Alaska"" sign. I liked that it is owner operated and not a part of a chain. It has a welcoming Alaskan feel. You will enjoy trying to hit golf balls across the river.", 5 stars 
Sirius Hertz,"King crab bisque was delightful, and the blueberry bread pudding even better. All on the back deck overlooking the river on a perfect August evening. I will definitely be back!", 5 stars 
James Perrizo,Pikes may be the best place in Fairbanks.  I am never disappointed in the food.  And everyone who works seems to care about your experience.  Downside is that in my 25 years of going on the deck there has always a service deficiency.  I think it would be foolish to assume that all the servers are deficient.  It may be systematic.  But I will go again to hang out on that lovely deck., 3 stars 
Waconda Clay,"The view was beautiful and the food was superb! A place to visit when you come to Fairbanks,  Alaska", 5 stars 
Judy D,We had the open sesame coconut prawn Asian salad and the walnut green apple cranberry feta and chicken salad. Our choices were delicious. The view was spectacular. I will stop here again next time I'm in Fairbanks., 5 stars 
Tycho Aussie,"Pikes Landing has a good selection of beer, and it has an amazing view of the river. You can also play a spendy game at their driving range, at a $1 per ball but it's kind of fun, especially when you land one on the green across the river. Service is good, except when things get busy. Then it's probably up to you to flag down your (probably overworked?) server. I spent a whole day here waiting for my evening flight at the airport. It's a pleasant place.", 4 stars 
Landon Messelheiser,Great views of the Chena River., 3 stars 
Latoya Adams,"Loved the hospitality. From the front desk Adam, and Michelle to the breakfast crew with Mrs. Kay. It helps when you have a manager Ms. Ursula who is so nice and helpful. It makes for a great team. This was my first time staying at Pike's and I was pleased. Looking forward to coming back in May. You made this traveling hairstylist very happy.üòÅ Thank you", 5 stars 
Amber Barrack,Amazing food and awesome outdoor seating!, 5 stars 
Alexia Hines,"My friends and I came here Sunday for brunch, which was served until 2pm. We enjoyed a  buffet of breakfast foods and lunch foods, desserts, and endless coffee and champagne. üòä The food was absolutely delicious and there were many vegetarian options. We chose to sit out on the deck, close to the water. Although there were no umbrellas at the tables there was shade on part of the deck and inside. 

We had spectacular service not only from the cook's in the back, but from our waiter as well. 
Needless to say, it was a wonderful time and we cannot wait to go back.", 5 stars 
Lisa Schlafmann,"Ordered the specialty hot apple pie drinks, but disappointingly, only one of us got to taste it as they were out of ingredients. The crab bisque was delicious! Great rustic atmosphere and good service - thanks, Crystal!", 4 stars 
Niki Cserni,Not as clean as you would expect food it hit or miss but bar always has great service, 3 stars 
Lisa G.,"This is a must if you are ever in Fairbanks, Alaska. Lots to see and do and a little history too. You'll love learning about the Iditarod Dog/Sled races and the history of The Last Great Race. You can also enjoy river activities, lodging and a delightful dining experience along the riverfront. Pike's Landing is another good reason to love Alaska.", 5 stars 
Evijo Evina,Very good you better visit, 5 stars 
Diane Lind,"I will give it 2 Stars only because our crab and seafood sandwiches were good. we had the rudest greeting when we walked in the door from a server who just said ""she was too busy to clean any tables. Go find something you can sit at"" in a very obnoxious way. We had a nice young man from Albania as a server but he was extremely slow. It took forever. I would not recommend this place simply because obviously there is no management that cares about bussing tables or having people that would greet customers in a nice manner no matter how busy they are or shorthanded they are. Where was the management! Someone should have been out there bussing tables and helping take care of many upset customers. We weren't the only ones that felt this way; we saw many.", 2 stars 
Eric Kitt,Nice place to relax and have drinks while overlooking the river. And its kid friendly!, 4 stars 
Michael Marth,Service was fast and the food was great. I had a beer with the prime rib sandwich with fries and the prime rib was very flavourful and juicy. Definitely recommended if you are looking for a meat option., 5 stars 
Ben Stacy,Always a great place to go in Fairbanks. Love eating on the deck in the summer sunshine., 5 stars 
Michael Lewis,"First timer here. Tried the Chili to get warmed up after a -20 degree walk this week.
Sorry, too much onion and oily cheese for my palate. 
Thought the cornbread muffins would help but no, dry and crumbly. 
Try again in the summer.", 3 stars 
Victor Hansen,"Great food, friendly service, and relaxed vibe. As a visitor, I know I'm in the right place if it's full of locals. Loved the Tower of Power appetizer. The halibut is phenomenal. If I'm ever back in Fairbanks, this is definitely on my list.", 5 stars 
he jiang,Very good place. Friendly and very good taste of food, 5 stars 
Paula Marth,The service was quick and friendly. I ordered the burger with veggies and my burger was great by the veggies were cold. I asked if I could get fries instead and I had it within a couple of minutes. Reasonably priced. Must try the berry vodka drink it was to die for., 4 stars 
denise l,Beautiful spot to launch a boat. No charge for launching., 5 stars 
Rossukon Jandech,"$49.99 for 3 kind of crab, mussels, sausage, and corns. Come along with lemon,butter, and bread. 
The seafood‚Äôs fresh, the sausage‚Äôs delicious. 
Before I headed to this place. I saw the picture of this dish was $39.99, but when got there, it‚Äôs not as that. They said for 2 people but I think for that amount, it‚Äôs only for one person. So a little pricy. 
They view was very impressive, looked out at the windows, it could see the river(snow at that time)", 4 stars 
Pranjali Sharma,"3.5 stars. The food is ok. The view and location on the other hand is fantastic! We got here early enough that we could sit across from the view of the frozen river. You can see the ""Love Alaska"" sign directly. 

We got the cheddar burger, one with fries, one with onion rings and a ciabatta to start with. 

The ciabatta was very good - warm, crunchy yet soft with the butter melting through. 

The burgers were just ok. We have definitely had much better burgers in Alaska. In fact we took this because we've had fantastic burgers before. So disappointed there. The fries were ok. The onion rings were fantastic! 

The experience was good, but the burgers didn't wow us. It's an easy spot for food if you're staying at the Pike's waterfront lodge.", 3 stars 
dorothy garcia,Good food ...great scenery.., 4 stars 
Cassandra Sewell,The view is amazing but the food leaves something to be desired., 1 star 
Fred Foster,"Spent the last 4 days eating meals at this establishment, spent over $600 and had wonderful experiences until these two came on shift Monday afternoon.  Neither one felt the need to provide so much as a smile.  Politely RUDE!", 1 star 
Dragonite 360,Amazing feel shut out to staff the business owner and partners.  To bring in my son‚Äôs 13th birthday with amazing five course meal can‚Äôt be that......., 5 stars 
T. Bolt,"In a rustic log-themed setting, a Sunday brunch featuring a large variety of seafood, ham, roast beef, assorted salads and dessert table. $26.95 or $20 for senior citizens. Coffee, juice, and Mimosas included. Starts 10 AM-2 PM
We returned for supper and ordered their Omega-3 salad with a huge slab of baked Copper River salmon (Sublime) on top $17.95; and a humongous 12-piece serving of spicy chicken wings-more than enough for a humongous appetite $13.95", 4 stars 
Michielle B,"We're coming from Atlanta and had no idea what we walked into. Very pleasantly surprised. Beautiful and delicious breakfast buffet complete with mimosas, fresh salmon, eggs Benedict, and everything you could imagine! Glad we stumbled in!", 5 stars 
Michael Shapiro,"Was an amazing stay. I may have been here in the dead of winter at minus 33, but the views were stunning.", 5 stars 
MrArcticraccoon,Beautiful day to be on deck. Food ok a little spendy for what you get., 3 stars 
Janet Hoffman,"Enjoyed the Lucky Seven coconut encrusted prawns, with French fries and coleslaw. The meal was tasty. Service was pretty good, food was hot when served, and served in a timely manner, but I never was offered a refill on my drink. Granted I was only drinking water, but would have appreciated a refill. Enjoyed the atmosphere, sat with my back to the fireplace and enjoyed the entire experience. Would definitely come back.", 4 stars 
Jared Knosky,"This is an old restaurant in Fairbanks, but the food is delicious.  We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms and then moved on to a ribeye sandwich and fried halibut. Both were very good.  The mushrooms  had a good roasted taste.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly as was the halibut and both were tasty.  The tartar sauce was on point and the Cole slaw was amazing.  I highly recommend eating at this place if you are visiting Fairbanks.  Especially if you are staying at Pike's Lodge.", 5 stars 
Michael West,"Great brunch before heading to airport, the Buffett had everything!", 5 stars 
Laurita Cottonham,"The Antioxidant Berry Salmon Salad is highly recommended! You have a large plate with a variety of fresh vegetables with cranberries, blueberries, and walnuts. The salmon is thick and grilled to perfection. The blueberry vinaigrette is the best!", 5 stars 
Ethel Reed,"Great dining with a large array of food choices and all sorts of beverages, desserts and wonderful scenery, professional friendly staffing.", 4 stars 
Daniel Foodie,Sunday brunch buffet is great. The breakfast food is good. It is rare to be able to have as much eggs Benedict as you want., 4 stars 
Eleonora Madonia,"We were waiting  about 20 minutes, nobody approached us  we just left.", 1 star 
Matt Moore,Ordered chicken caesar salad.  Chicken was good but the salad was a lettuce mix w caesar dressing. Not exactly up to snuff. You'd do better by getting a burger., 4 stars
